echo # Campus Energy-Use Dashboard

This project is my capstone assignment for *Programming for Problem Solving using Python*. I analysed electricity usage data from three buildings: Home, Cricket Academy, and Library. The program reads all CSV files from the data folder, cleans them, calculates daily and weekly totals, generates a dashboard image, and creates a summary report.

## Project Files
- main.py  
- dashboard.png  
- summary.txt  
- cleaned_energy_data.csv  
- building_summary.csv  
- data/ (contains all building CSV files)

## What the Code Does
1. Loads all CSV files from the **data** folder  
2. Cleans and merges the data  
3. Calculates building-wise, daily, and weekly energy usage  
4. Uses OOP classes for better structure  
5. Generates a dashboard with three charts  
6. Saves the final summary to summary.txt  

## How to Run the Project
pip install pandas matplotlib
python main.py

## My Buildings and Data
- home_block_2024-01.csv  
- cricket_academy_2024-01.csv  
- library_block_2024-01.csv  

## Output Generated Automatically
- dashboard.png  
- cleaned_energy_data.csv  
- building_summary.csv  
- summary.txt
